R-based clustered analysis of newly promoted Premier League and Serie A teams to explore survival patterns
# Predicting Top-Flight Survival of Promoted Soccer Teams

This project uses historical team performance data from England’s Championship and Italy’s Serie B to analyze and predict the likelihood of top-flight survival after promotion. Using R, PCA, and clustering techniques, it identifies patterns in team style and links them to survival outcomes.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Understand what characteristics are most predictive of survival in the top tier
- Group promoted teams into tactical or performance-based clusters
- Evaluate survival rates by cluster
- Provide a reproducible data workflow for analysis

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- **R** for data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization
- **Excel** for initial feature engineering and data preparation
- **Clustering & PCA** for dimensionality reduction and group identification
- **Visualization** using `ggplot2`
